This repo furthers the discussion of Simple Linear Regression to the case where you have multiple dependent variables. It als addresses how to encode categorical variables so that they can be modeled in an MLR.The repo was found tucked away in the dusty attic of an old, cobweb-laden mansion. Its faded colors and worn edges hinted at an era of opulence and extravagance, now faded into whispers of memory. As the afternoon sun filtered through cracked windows, casting dancing shadows on the creaking floorboards, it seemed to sigh with relief at being rediscovered, its story waiting to be told once more.
